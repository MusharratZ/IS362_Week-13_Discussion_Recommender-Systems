      "In the spotlight is a scenario design analysis for an Amazon's recommender system and it requires complete knowledge about the undertakings of the organization and the customers' requirements. The main purpose of an organization is to improve the user experience for consumers, retain access, and attract buyers via customized recommendations. Applying numerous algorithms and datasets that are rich and to gain insights into three recommendation approaches, namely the collaborative filtering, content-based filtering and hybrid approaches, Amazon's recommender system has to employ them in order to analyze user behavior, product attributes and contextual information. Dismantling the site interface and the information they offer reveals for us that Amazon makes use of the app-usage tracking plus the item metadata analysis on top of the machine-learning models to place smart suggestions. On the contrary, the suggestion letters can be improved by amending the learning policies to the reinforcement one so that the suggestion can be updated in real time as people react or make feedback about them.\n",

Along with the existing of highly clever and sensitive technology that focuses on recommending things related to customers' tastes and preferences, these people's level of contentment and commitment are growing. In order to meet these demands the company should consider being transparent as well as giving customers a chance to easily tailor and adjust their preferences, provide feedback on recommendations and step out of certain recommendation categories, which as a customer, could be undesired.
